          <p><span class="waiver__sub-heading">CONSENT OF A MINOR</span>: Any children age 13 or under must have a parent present to complete this release waiver and consent form. If a child under the age of 13 completes this release waiver and consent form without the knowledge of a parent, the parent should reach out to the Provider immediately. A parent can contact the Provider at any time to address, restrict or remove any online profile or publicity of personal information that is within the control of the Provider. If a parent or child(ren) experience any challenge participating in the youth sports programs offered by the Provider due to an unwillingness to provide personal information or consent to the terms and conditions set for by the Provider, the parent should contact the Provider in writing, addressed to management, with specific concerns, examples and requests. </p>
          <p><span class="waiver__sub-heading">MEDICAL RELEASE</span>: Pursuant to the provisions of sections 6910 et seq. of the California Family Code, and other applicable laws, I hereby authorize Providers to procure and consent to, medical, hospital or dental care for myself or my child in the event of injury as a result of participation in the Providers’ Programs or Activities.</p>
          <p><span class="waiver__sub-heading">COVID-19</span>: I understand that Providers cannot prevent the presence of COVID-19 at the Premises or prevent the possibility that me or my child(ren) will be exposed to, contract with, or spread COVID-19 while entering into and or utilizing the Premises. I am aware of and acknowledge the seriousness of the risks associated with COVID-19. I HEREBY CHOOSE TO ACCEPT THE RISK OF CONTRACTING AND/OR SPREADING COVID-19 FOR MYSELF AND/OR MY CHILD(REN) IN ORDER TO BE ALLOWED TO ENTER INTO AND UTILIZE THE PREMISES. In consideration of my participation in the Programs or Activities and on behalf of myself, and any of all of my family members, minor child(ren), my heirs, successors, assigns and personal representatives and each of them, having voluntarily and knowingly entered the Premises , I HEREBY FOREVER RELEASE AND WAIVE MY RIGHT TO BRING SUIT AGAINST THE PROVIDERS THEIR OWNERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, OFFICIALS, TRUSTEES, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES AND OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES (RELEASED PARTIES) IN CONNECTION WITH ANY AND ALL EXPOSURE, INFECTION, AND/OR SPREAD OF COVID-19 RELATED TO ME AND/OR MY CHILD(REN) ENTERING INTO AND OR UTILIZING THE PREMISES. I understand that this waiver and release means that I have forever discharged the released parties and give up all of my right to bring any claims, actions, lawsuits, demands for damages and or losses, including for personal injuries, death, disease or property losses, or any other loss, including but not limited to claims of negligence and give up any claim I or my child(ren) may have to seek damages against the Released Parties, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen to the maximum extent allowed by law.</p>

          <p><span class="waiver__sub-heading">WEBSITE/SOCIAL MEDIA RELEASE</span>: I hereby agree to allow and authorize my child(ren)'s name, image, likeness and any related content on any and all platforms of social media in the interest of creating awareness, recognition and support for the Providers.

I acknowledge that if a specific article is removed from a website or social media, the content may be found on other public online or social media platforms as a result of sharing, reposting or copying. I waive any and all liability for any damages or claims arising out of the Provider using my own or my child(ren)'s name, image and likeness on a website or social media platform.</p>
          <p><span class="waiver__sub-heading">CONSENT TO PERSONAL INFORMATION</span>: I acknowledge that the Provider is collecting or my child(ren)'s personal information in order to produce public, online profiles featuring my child(ren)'s youth sports accomplishments, pictures, videos, awards, statistics and any other key metrics related to youth sports performance. The information obtained is used only for specific reasons related to the nature of the youth sports services we provide. If parent or child(ren) does not consent to publication of any related data, personal information, photograph, video or any aspect of name, image or likeness, they must notify the Provider in advance of participating in any program or event. </p>
          <p><span class="waiver__sub-heading">WAIVER AND RELEASE OF LIABILITY</span>: In consideration of my participation in the Providers Programs and Activities or as an attending parent or spectator at the Premises, I HEREBY RELEASE, DISCHARGE AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE the Providers, their owners, officers, directors, employees, representatives and volunteers, from any and all present and future claims, demands, actions, payment and/or reimbursement of medical expenses, or causes of action resulting from any accidents, injuries, deaths, or loss of and/or damage to my/our person(s) or property arising out of or connected with my/our participation in any Programs and Activities while at the Premises.
